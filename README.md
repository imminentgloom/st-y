# støy

![støy](screenshot.png)

støy (/stœj/) is noise

i made this to play scratchy, screeching, sputtering noises, you can play too

works with norns, grid optional
install via maiden or dowload to ‘dust/code’, then restart norns

it's ok to add the ø back into the folder name, it is real letter
