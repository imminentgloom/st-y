# støy

![støy](screenshot.png)

støy (/stœj/) is noise

skittering, scratching, sputtering sounds from a trio of oscillators that respectively feed, fm and am a filter, there is feedback and a delay if you want. a button makes it all (except the delay) stop.

i made this to see if i could play the same kind of music on norns as i have done for years on my modular, they both feel similar, familiar, but also different.

if you want you can play too



requires norns, grid optional



e1 pitch
e2 chooses
e3 affects

k1+e1 pitch, fine
k1+e2 delay rate
k1+e3 delay feedback

k2 momentary delay send
k3 momentary mute

16 snapshots
k1+row1 save
k2+row2-8 load

set persistence = true on line 41 to start where you left off, defaults to false/default sound



install from maiden or download to ‘dust/code’, then restart norns
